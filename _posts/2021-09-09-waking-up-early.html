<p>Hello People, today, here I'm with another interesting subject. I recently started an activity and I would like to share with you the results. The activity I'm talking about is Journaling. As the name indicates, it's a writing exercise. By journaling, you can externalize your inner thoughts on a piece of paper. You can do it for many reasons: pleasure, understanding yourself, sharing your idea with the world, and much more. </p>
<p><code>Journaling</code> is a mind exercise as well. It can help you have a deep understanding of what is going on inside you when you are serious with it. Being serious in journaling consists of writing about everything that comes out from your mind. Your ideas, your projects, thing that you are happy with. Whatever comes out of you mind, juts write it down. </p>
<p>The exercise becomes more powerful especially when you do it after waking up. During your sleep, your subconscious just spent a couple of hours processing a lot of information. If you want to know about the result that inner process, take a piece of paper and a pen and just WRITE.</p>
<h2>Being an early bird.</h2>
<p>For the last thirty days, I woke up at around 5:45 AM. This can be hard for some people. But it is actually the best time to use if you want to journal. Someone said : “Master you morning and you master everything.”. When you tell your brain to wake up early, you are actually developing a sense of urgency. You wake up because you have to do something that you like, or that is really important to you to master your inside.</p>
<p>Waking up early has many virtues. First, it gives you more time to accomplish more things during the day. For instance, if you start journaling because you woke up early, then Journaling is a new activity you are adding to your todos list. Isn't that a good thing, you are accomplishing more than before. Time very often feels like it contracts throughout our whole lives and especially if we have a lot to do. Some of this is a matter of perception, but part of it is that as we go through the day, unexpected demands arise. Projects and problems appear that we never could have anticipated. Waking up early not only gives us extra time, but that time seems to be the ore productive of the day.</p>
<p>Second, you probably have noticed. Early in the morning there are fewer distraction. The household is still on sleep. You can get done what you need to get done. Whether you live with family or with other people, the earlier you wake up, the less likely anyone else will be up. The quiet of the early morning offers a special energy for reflection, focused attention, and a fresh quality of the mind. The early morning is a great time to work on life goals, plan out your day or even catch up on some good reading.</p>
<h2>Commitment.</h2>
<p>In this world, the minority of people can embrace a commitment or have the habit of waking up early. Therefore being an early bird is a form of commitment. It is a commitment to yourself, to your success,  to your life. In the previous chapter, we describe the pros of waking up early. For instance in my situation, I dedicated the morning to work on my blog and my business. I have been able to increase my productivity a lot by simply add 3 more early hours to my planning. This is the kind of commitment I like.</p>
<h2>Result.</h2>
<p>I told you at the beginning that we are going to discuss some results of <code>30 days of journaling</code>. I started the journaling on <code>July 22nd</code>. I have been able to write <code>300 words per days</code>. That gives us an approximation of <code>300 * 31</code> which is <code>9,300 words</code>. <code>31</code> comes from the fact that I did not count the weekend day. <code>9300 words</code> can make a little book. Could you imagine that? After about <code>a month of journaling</code>, you would have written <code>a book of 10,000 words</code> ready to be published. The average book out there has about 50,000 words. So, by waking up every day at 6AM for about a month and dedicate 10 minutes to write, I produced one fifth of the content of a regular book. By repeating this scenario five time, I will be able to publish a best seller book, right? You probably do not trust me. Why not you try it? See you ...</p>

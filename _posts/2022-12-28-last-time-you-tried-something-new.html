<p>Everyone of us have been repeating tasks over and over, days after days. From waking up on the same side of the bed to the time when we eat the dinner and so on. We live a routine life.</p>

<p>I believe it comes down to how human being has been designed by nature. It's difficult for human being to get out of the comfort zone once in. Our brain is designed to repreatedly perfomr the same tasks over and over unless we take action to change.</p>

<p>Trying something new is an execption that only winners follow. The value of everything is found when trying something new. Even when you are solving a problem, sometime, you have to try a new approach or a different approach to find the answer.</p>

<p>I set myself and habit of trying something new everyday. As little as it could just be to use my left hand to brush my teeth, because I'm right hand, I would do it. Do not underestimate the power it has to rewiring your braain.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, if you hate trying something new like me before, work on that skill, everyday, bit by bit and I'm sure you will never regret taking that action.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
